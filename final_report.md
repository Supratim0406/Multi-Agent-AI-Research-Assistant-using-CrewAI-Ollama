# Executive Summary

In 2026, we can expect the integration of AI into everyday life to increase significantly with more Silicon Valley apps quietly shipping on top of Chinese open models (Anabelle Nicoud, IBM). The global market for AI is projected to grow significantly from $190.6 billion in 2020 to $602.36 billion by 2026 (MarketsandMarkets), creating opportunities for job creation. However, there are concerns about the potential deflation of the AI bubble and its impact on the economy (Erik Brynjolfsson, MIT Sloan School of Management). Energy demand will likely pose a major challenge for AI deployment, and efforts should be made to address this issue. Companies are encouraged to adopt an enterprise-wide strategy centered on a top-down program to stay competitive in the rapidly evolving AI landscape (PwC).
